# Sports teams with the longest winning streaks.

This example investigates which team had the longest streak of
consecutive wins in a given series or league of sports events.
We return the record-length streaks and a table of all proper
streaks.
 
The example shows:
- how to import data from Wikidata with SPARQL queries,
- how to use parameters to define values that matter to a program,
- how to use rules to answer a query that cannot be expressed in SPARQL,
- how to use aggregates to measure the length of a path and to find the longest path
- how to select predicates for output.

Note: Our task here is simpler since the sports events form a sequence.
Finding longest path in an arbitrary directed graph is more complicated.
